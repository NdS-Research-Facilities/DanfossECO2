# DanfossECO2

This code can run on macosx to integrate the mac bluetooth BLE stack with the Danfoss ECO2 etrv.
raw code so working now on making it into a proper class and getting more generic functions setup (like which eco2 to control)

uses PyObjC to interface with mac corebleutooth library

need to press button to retrieve key for en/decryption.

all fb welcome
