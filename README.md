# DanfossECO2

This code can run on macosx to integrate the mac bluetooth BLE stack with the Danfoss ECO2 etrv.
raw code so working now on making it into a proper class and getting more generic functions setup (like which eco2 to control)

uses PyObjC to interface with mac corebleutooth library

need to press button to retrieve key for en/decryption.

plan now is to build an MQTT interface which can be queried by e.g. home-assistant

all fb welcome
